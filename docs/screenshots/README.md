# Desktop Screenshot Archive

This folder stores full-window desktop screenshots (`dashboard`, `vault`, `logs`, `budget`, `providers`, `settings`).

Current actively referenced launch/media visuals live in:
- `docs/launch/`

Use this folder for archival captures only. For current release-facing assets, prefer the `docs/launch/` set.
